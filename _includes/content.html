<h3>Ottawa International Animation Festival</h3>
<p>Print and Design work for the Festival, working with curated poster to create a variety of promotional print and animated web advertisements. I was also tasked with designing and laying out the Festival Program Guide.
I also created the illustration for welcome page. My goal was to incorporate characters from the most prominent shorts and screenings in the festival to create a visual introduction to the festival.
