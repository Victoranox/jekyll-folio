<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>Having grown up in rural Canada, I am a fan of the outdoors and love to take inspiration from the natural and the unknown. While they say pictures are worth a thousand words, I aim to create pictures that focus into a more precise and cohesive understanding. We are a social species, and despite having spent most of my childhood surrounded by nothing but trees and farmers fields I’ve come to love how we express eachothers ideas in words and pictures. I aim to inform people with the applications, layouts, painting and posters I design.<br>
Every day we’re faced with situations and people we don’t fully understand. As a designer I aim to bridge gaps between creators and customers, developers and users -to help bring attainability and visual holesumess to those who need it. I love seeing my work come to life in both professional application and in animation.
