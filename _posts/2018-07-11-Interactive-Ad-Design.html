  <h2>Interactive Player Ads</h2>

<div class="gutter pad-t">
  <p>This is a collection of interactive ads created over the years for a variety of proof of concept applications. Multiple formats were explored: Some were full screen experiences that were dismissable after a certain amount of time. Others were lower third ads that could be interacted with during stream with tv remote functions. Various examples and formats were made to show clients the potential and diversity of advertising applications within streaming apps. Many samples were made with existing and current advertising campaigns in mind for demonstration.
