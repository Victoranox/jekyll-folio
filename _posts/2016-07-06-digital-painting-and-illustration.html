<p class="gutter pad-t">This is a self portrait of myslef, painted in photoshop using default brush presets. I wanted to challenge myslef by capturing both dynamic shanding as well as intricate detail. My aim was not to create a caraceture, nor an ideal verson of myself. Rather I wanted capture a moment with myslef, that despite my flawed skin and frustraiting paleness; I still smile and embrace the moment.</p>
