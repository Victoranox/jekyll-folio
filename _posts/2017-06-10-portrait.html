<h2>Self Portrait - 2017</h2>

<div class="gutter">
  <p>This is a self portrait of myself I made in 2017. I chose dramatic lighting and an expression that would accentuate certain creases in my face. My aim at the time was to capture my average looking face with its flaws. I left my mild acne in and made no attempt to make my nose look appealingly smaller. I was  satisfied with it in the end, knowing that it was an honest portrayal of myself at the time. The addition of pine branches along the bottom is a nod to my roots in rural Canada.</p>
  <p>Overall, this was a fun exploration and helped me hone my digital painting skills in Photoshop.</p>
